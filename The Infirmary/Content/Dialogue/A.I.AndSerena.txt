Serena: Can you tell me what is happening?
A.I.: It seems there was an error with the software that let you just view into this time. 
Serena: What does that mean?
A.I.: You will be stuck here until you fix the fried part of the head gear. Once that is fix it will take you back.
Serena: How do I do that!?
A.I.: Collect the pieces and I will tell you how to do it but do not get caught.
A.I.: I suggest you wait here until the Matron has left. 
Serena: You make it sound so easy.
A.I. remains quiet.
Serena: Alright then.
